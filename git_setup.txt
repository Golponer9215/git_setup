After downloading, install it by clicking Next all the way.

When done, open your Terminal or Command Prompt.

Type this command to check if Git was installed:

Open your terminal and type:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
Replace "Your Name" and "you@example.com" with your real name and email.

 Challenges i Face
1. Git Commands Confusing
Sometimes itâ€™s hard to remember commands like git add, git commit, and git push.

Tip: Write them down or use a cheat sheet until you get used to it.

2. Error Messages
You might see errors like:

"Permission denied"

"fatal: not a git repository"

Tip: Donâ€™t panic. Just Google the error message. Everyone sees them when learning!

3. Push Failed
This happens when you try to push code without setting things up properly.

Tip: Make sure you did git remote add origin ... and that your GitHub repo is empty.
